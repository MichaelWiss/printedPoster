# Cart Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Product Card Cart Integration**
**Problem**: ProductCard component had static HTML for add-to-cart button that wasn't functional.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced static HTML with functional `AdvancedAddToCartButton` component

- Added proper cart store integration

**Files Modified**:
- `components/product/ProductCard.tsx`

### 2. **Enhanced Product Details Cart Integration**

**Solution**:

- Added proper stock status indicators
- Integrated with cart loading states

**Files Modified**:
- `components/product/MassProducedVariantSelector.tsx`

- Connected existing purchase button to cart functionality
- Added proper loading states and stock status

**Files Modified**:

**Solutions**:
- Fixed unused imports in multiple files
